# time-bound-computation
Matrix multiplication is used for producing a single matrix from two matrices. It's computation has a general time complexity of O(N^3). This project shows its time bound computation using numpy, pure python, numba and a C based shared library.

## Prerequisites
python3  
numba module for python3
